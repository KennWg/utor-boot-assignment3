# This is a password generator.  When the button is pressed, user will be prompted to select a length or use the default of 8 characters.  They will be able to select whether to include lower case characters, upper case characters, numerical characters and symbols, which will then be generated as a password.  If the generated password does not meet the requirements, it will re-generate the password until every requirement specified is met, then display it to the page.
